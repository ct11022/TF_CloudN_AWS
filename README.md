# tf_cloudn_1x2x2_aws_tb
This is a terraform script is use for build a standard testbed with 1 Controller 1 Tr with HA, 1 Spoke with HA, 1 Spoke end VM in AWS CSP to CloudN testing 

## CloudN CaaG smoke test (AWS)

### Description

This Terraform configuration launches a new Aviatrix controller in AWS. Then, it initializes controller and installs with specific released version. It also configures 1 Spoke(HA) GWs and attaches to Transit(HA) GW 

### Prerequisites
